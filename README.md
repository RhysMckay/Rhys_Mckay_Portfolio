# Covid-19 Vaccination Analysis Project


**Introduction** 
The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a global push for widespread vaccination, with vaccination campaigns occurring daily in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. This project aims to meticulously track the dissemination of the COVID-19 vaccine during the critical period between 04/09/20 and 25/10/21. Additionally, we will delve into the intriguing interplay between a country's GDP and its vaccination rate. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of vaccination strategies and their implications for global public health.


**Data Sourced from:** [Our World in Data - Covid-19 Vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)  
**Technologies Used:** Tableau, Python

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
1. Investigate the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on countries in proportion to their GDP.
2. Track the spread of the COVID-19 vaccine and determine how many out of the population were unvaccinated, part vaccinated or fully vaccinated.

**Steps Taken:**

1. Checked data for cleanliness using Python scripts to ensure accuracy and identify extreme values.
2. Imported data into Tableau and created KPI worksheets to organize demographic information for analysis.
3. Conducted preliminary analysis to extract basic insights, such as the number of partially and fully vaccinated individuals, and calculated relevant percentages.
4. Visualized KPIs against each other, exploring data relationships and making connections between correlated KPIs that would give insightful data for each.
5. Creating dashboards for presentation and for further exporation of data in given periods, in certain continents and in specific countries.
6. formatting final dashboard for clearer presentation and communication of findings. 


**Challenges Faced:**
- Data had extreme values, resulting in countries having an over 100% vaccination rate. Addressed by removing the values after deeming they would not impact overall result from analysis.

**Recommendations for Future Analysis:**
- Further exploration could be done by investigating the link between a country's population and its vaccination rate, as well as exploring the availability of standard healthcare in relation to the vaccination rate. To enhance this future analysis, consider evaluating potential data sources and methodologies that could shed light on the disparities in the rollout of critical medical relief, especially in countries with lower GDPs.

**Conclusion:**
- The COVID-19 vaccination effort, as of the data cutoff in October 2021, showed a steady pace. A clear relationship between GDP per capita and vaccination rates emerged, with higher vaccination rates found predominantly in countries with higher GDPs. Notably, over half of the global population lacked a single vaccine dose at the time of data publication. While our analysis points to a connection between a country's economic strength and its ability to receive and administer critical medical aid efficiently, it's crucial to acknowledge potential limitations in the data capturing the full complexity of this global health scenario. Further analysis would be required to prove a claim like this.
